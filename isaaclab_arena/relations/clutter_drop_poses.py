"""Drop-pose generation for clutter placement.

A pile cannot be produced by the relation solver: ``On`` requires each child's whole
footprint to rest on one Z plane and a global pairwise no-overlap loss forbids contact,
whereas a pile is defined by objects touching and resting on one another. Clutter is
therefore placed by dropping objects into a region and letting the simulator settle them.

This module computes the *drop* poses only -- the pre-settle layout. It is pure geometry
with no simulator dependency, so it is cheap and directly testable. Poses are guaranteed
free of mutual penetration at spawn, which lets them double as the scene's spawn poses.

The two properties that make the layout safe:

* Each object's sampled XY is constrained so its yaw-rotated footprint lies inside the
  region, rather than only its origin.
* Objects are lifted only over the footprints they actually overlap (a per-column ladder),
  so an object with a clear column starts just above the floor instead of above the whole
  pile. This keeps drop heights -- and therefore impact energy and scatter -- small.
