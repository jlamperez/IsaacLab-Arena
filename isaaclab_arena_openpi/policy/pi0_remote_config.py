# TODO(cvolk, 2026-05-18): unify the remote-policy config story across arena.
# Today openpi uses a Python dataclass (this file) and gr00t uses a YAML config
# (--policy_config_yaml_path). Decide on one mechanism (likely Hydra) when the
# planned RemotePolicy base class lands; the config-loading shape belongs there.
